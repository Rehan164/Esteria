# Esteria
## About
Esteria is a survival game where you (the player) plays as the hero to save the world from demons and monster that have travelled through gates of Hades into the overworld or play as the villian of the story to gain the trust of the monsters to overrule the overworld and become the demon king.

When you spawn into the world you are given the base rank, E rank with only a power level of 30 (the average power level of a living). Killing monsters, completing quest, and training will increase your rank. Of course highest rank is S class.
